# Music Bot

[![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

A self-hosted Discord music bot that streams audio from YouTube using slash
commands. Built with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py),
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), and FFmpeg.

## Features

- 🎵 **Stream from YouTube** — play a direct link or search by keywords and pick from a dropdown
- 📋 **Per-guild queues** — append, view, skip, pause/resume, and clear the queue
- 💾 **Shared playlists** — save tracks into named playlists per server, then play them (with optional shuffle)
- 🔁 **Resilient playback** — auto-reconnects with backoff and re-fetches expired stream URLs
- 👋 **Auto-disconnect** — leaves when the channel empties or after 5 minutes of inactivity

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Python 3.10+ | Uses `asyncio.get_running_loop()` and modern type hints |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Package and venv manager (or use plain `pip`) |
| FFmpeg | `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` must be on your `PATH` |
| A Discord bot token | Create one at [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) |

Installing FFmpeg:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Arch / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows (winget) — or download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
```

Verify it works with `ffmpeg -version`.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/CaptainShepard01/Music_Bot.git
cd Music_Bot

# 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# (or with pip: python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt)

# 3. Create your .env file and add your token
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env`:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
```

> **Never commit `.env`** — it holds your secret token. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.

### Discord developer portal

When you generate the bot's invite URL, enable:

- **Scopes:** `bot` and `applications.commands`
- **Bot permissions:** Connect, Speak, Send Messages, Embed Links

No privileged gateway intents are required.

## Running

```bash
uv run python bot.py
```

Slash commands are registered globally on startup. Global commands can take up
to an hour to appear in every server the first time.

## Running as a systemd service (Linux)

The bot ships with a systemd unit and an install script that auto-detects your
user, working directory, and venv Python path. Run it from inside the project
directory:

```bash
chmod +x install-service.sh
./install-service.sh
```

Then start and (optionally) enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start music-bot
sudo systemctl enable music-bot  # auto-start on boot
journalctl -u music-bot -f       # follow logs
```

> **Note:** systemd's `EnvironmentFile` reads `KEY=VALUE` pairs literally — do
> **not** wrap the value in quotes in `.env` (a plain `DISCORD_TOKEN=abc123` is correct).

## Commands

### Playback
